        <h1>Terms of Service for See<span>Again</span></h1>
        <p class="subtitle">
          These Terms explain how you can use SeeAgain. By using the site, you agree to these Terms.
        </p>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: December 14, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. What SeeAgain does</h2>
        <p>
          SeeAgain lets you upload photos and generate short animations using AI-powered tools. We
          may also offer additional features like prompt suggestions, sharing, and downloads.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Your account and eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          You must be able to legally enter into this agreement in your region to use SeeAgain. The
          service is not intended for children under 13. If you use SeeAgain on behalf of someone
          else (for example, a business), you confirm that you are authorized to do so.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Your content</h2>
        <p>
          You keep all rights to the photos and other content you upload. By using SeeAgain, you
          grant us a limited license to process that content as needed to provide the service
          (including creating animations, showing previews, and operating SeeAgain).
        </p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for ensuring that you have the right to upload the photos you use
          (for example, you have permission from the people in the images).
        </p>

        <h2>4. Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to use SeeAgain to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Break the law or infringe on others' rights.</li>
          <li>Upload abusive, harassing, or hateful content.</li>
          <li>Upload sexually explicit, extremely violent, or otherwise inappropriate content.</li>
          <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, attack, or disrupt the service or underlying systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. AI-generated content</h2>
        <p>
          Animations and suggestions produced by SeeAgain are generated by AI models. Results may
          not be perfect or accurate and may occasionally behave in unexpected ways. You use the
          generated content at your own discretion.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Payments and refunds</h2>
        <p>
          Some features (such as additional animations after a free trial) may require payment. These
          payments are processed by third-party providers like Stripe. Prices and offerings may
          change over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless we clearly state otherwise, payments for completed animations are generally
          non-refundable, except where required by law.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Service changes and availability</h2>
        <p>
          We may improve, update, or change SeeAgain from time to time. We may also pause or stop
          offering parts of the service, including for security, legal, or technical reasons.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>
          SeeAgain is provided "as is" and "as available." We do not guarantee that the service will
          be error-free, uninterrupted, or that generated content will always meet your expectations.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent allowed by law, SeeAgain and its creators will not be liable for any
          indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising out of or in connection
          with your use of the service.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Changes to these Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms occasionally. When we do, we will change the "Last updated"
          date at the top. In some cases, we may provide additional notice on the main site. If you
          continue using SeeAgain after changes take effect, you agree to the updated Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Contact</h2>
