        <h1>Privacy Policy for See<span>Again</span></h1>
        <p class="subtitle">
          We built SeeAgain to help you bring your photos to life. This page explains how we handle
          your information in clear, simple language.
        </p>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: December 14, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. What we collect</h2>
        <p>When you use SeeAgain, we may collect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Photos you upload</strong> so we can generate animations.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Animation prompts and settings</strong> so we can create the requested video and
            improve the experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Basic device and usage information</strong> (for example, browser type,
            approximate location, and how you interact with the site) to keep SeeAgain running
            smoothly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payment-related information</strong> (handled securely by Stripe) when you pay
            for additional animations.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How we use your information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Generate and deliver your photo animations.</li>
          <li>Operate, maintain, and improve SeeAgain.</li>
          <li>Prevent abuse, troubleshoot issues, and keep the service secure.</li>
          <li>Process payments for paid features using third-party providers like Stripe.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How we handle your photos</h2>
        <p>
          Your uploaded photos are used to generate animations and to power features like prompt
          suggestions. We do not sell your photos or use them to train our own separate public
          models.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third-party AI providers may process your images and prompts as part of generating the
          animation (for example, image-to-video models). We attempt to work with providers that
          offer strong privacy and security controls.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Payments</h2>
        <p>
          Payments for SeeAgain are processed by <strong>Stripe</strong> or similar third-party
          payment processors. We do not store your full credit card number on our servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any payment information you provide is handled under the payment processor's own privacy
          policy.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Cookies and analytics</h2>
        <p>
          We may use cookies or similar technologies to keep you logged in, remember basic settings,
          and understand how people use SeeAgain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where we use analytics tools, we aim to use them in a way that respects user privacy and
          avoids collecting more data than necessary.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
        <p>
          We keep your data only for as long as we reasonably need it to operate the service,
          comply with legal obligations, or resolve disputes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may keep anonymized or aggregated data (that cannot reasonably be used to identify you)
          for analytics and service improvement.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Your choices</h2>
        <p>Depending on where you live, you may have rights such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Requesting access to the personal data we hold about you.</li>
          <li>Requesting corrections to inaccurate information.</li>
          <li>Requesting deletion of certain data, subject to legal and operational limits.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you'd like to exercise any of these rights or ask a question about your data, you can
          email us at
          <a href="mailto:seeagainmoments@gmail.com">seeagainmoments@gmail.com</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Children's privacy</h2>
        <p>
          SeeAgain is not designed for children under 13. If you believe a child has used the
          service and provided personal information, please contact us and we will review and, where
          appropriate, delete the information.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will update
          the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. In some cases, we may provide additional
          notice (for example, on the main site).
        </p>
